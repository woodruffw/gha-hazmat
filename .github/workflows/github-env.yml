# github-env.yml
#
# what:
# this vulnerability compounds with dangerous Workflow triggers,
# like pull_request_target.
#
# since the triggered Workflow runs in the context of the upstream repository,
# in the proper scenario an attacker can manipulate what goes through
# $GITHUB_ENV, either adding new variables to the environment or tweaking
# existing well-known ones (e.g. variables used by programming languages)
#
# how:
# user error.
