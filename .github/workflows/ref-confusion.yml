# ref-confusion.yml
#
# what: GitHub Actions allows actions and reusable workflows to be pinned
# to individual tag or branch refs. however, tag and branch refs have
# ambiguous overlapping namespaces: `@foo` might refer to `/refs/tags/foo`
# or `/refs/heads/foo`. in practice GitHub Actions appears to prefer
# the branch namespace over the tag namespace, meaning that an action
# pinned as `@foo` where `foo` is a tag might suddently begin using a
# different (and potentially malicious) action if someone is able to push
# to the `foo` branch.
#
# how: an attacker without the ability to create tags but with the ability
# to create branches on a particular repo may be able to induce unrelated
# repositories into running malicious action code.
