# self-hosted.yml
#
# what:
# runs jobs on a self-hosted runner. self-hosted runners *can* be used
# securely in "ephemeral" setups (where the runner is torn down after
# each job), but this is not the default and is commonly not the case.
#
# as such, self-hosted runners should generally not be used within public
# repositories. the exception to this is ephemeral runners, but there's
# no easy way to distinguish these at the workflow level.
#
# how:
# misconfiguration.
#
# see also: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security
