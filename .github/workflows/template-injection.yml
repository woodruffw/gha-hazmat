# template-injection.yml
#
# what:
# GitHub Actions has a template and expression language, delimited by
# `${{ ... }}`, that can be inserted into most parts of a workflow.
# expression evaluation and expansion happens before the workflow is
# executed, meaning that an attacker who controls the expansion of a
# template may be able to bypass normal shell quoting and escaping
# rules to inject code directly into a `runs:` step.
#
# how:
# many workflows allow free-form user inputs, which an attacker can
# use for injection. similarly, many workflows run on triggers that
# include multiple sources of attacker-controlled input, such
# as `github.event.issue.title` being whatever string the attacker creates
# a new issue with.
